# survey
This is an analysis of IBM Employee survey data 

Problem:
With our data set from IBM Human resource. We aim to gain insite to why are our best and most experienced employees leave prematurely and to predicting who may leave. This insite will alows to intervene when nessary.

Insight:
The majority of our employees do not have attrition in the work place. Almost all employees in sernior positions(making higher monthly income) are occupied by employees without attirtion. There is a signifigant drop of non-attrition employess when their income is greater than 10,000 per month. This point is where non-attriton employees quit and the best place for us to start our intervention. For long term growth we should aim to reduce attrition at all level of emplyees.
